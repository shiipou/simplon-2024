## What is Technical Documentation?

%%
**Technical Documentation** refers to all written materials that explain how software is built, how it works, and how to use it. 

It provides essential information for developers, testers, and end users, helping them understand and work with the software efficiently. This includes API guides, architecture descriptions, and troubleshooting instructions.

## Writing Effective Technical Documentation

- **Know Your Audience**
- **Be Concise and Clear**
- **Organize Information Logically**
- **Include Examples**
- **Update Regularly**

%%
To write clear and helpful technical documentation:

- **Know Your Audience**: Tailor the complexity level to suit developers, testers, or end users.
- **Be Concise and Clear**: Avoid jargon where possible and explain terms as needed.
- **Organize Information Logically**: Use headings, lists, and sub-sections to make it scannable.
- **Include Examples**: Provide code snippets, sample API requests, and output examples to clarify complex information.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep documentation current with software changes and new features.

## Best Practices for Documentation

- **Use Consistent Language and Formatting**
- **Provide Context**
- **Document Edge Cases**
- **Encourage Team Contributions**
- **Incorporate Visuals**

%%
- **Use Consistent Language and Formatting**: Helps maintain readability and professionalism.
- **Provide Context**: Explain not just what the code does but why certain approaches were chosen.
- **Document Edge Cases**: Describe any uncommon but critical behaviors, errors, or limitations.
- **Encourage Team Contributions**: Keep documentation collaborative so all team members can contribute updates.
- **Incorporate Visuals**: Use diagrams or flowcharts to clarify architecture and workflows when possible.

## Introduction to Swagger

%%
**Swagger** is an open-source tool used to document and interact with RESTful APIs. It includes:

- **OpenAPI Specification**: A format for defining API structures.
- **Swagger UI**: An interactive user interface for testing and exploring APIs.
- **Code Generation**: Tools to generate client libraries and server stubs.

Swagger documentation makes it easier for developers to understand, test, and work with APIs.
%%

---

## Benefits of Swagger Documentation

1. **API Visualization**: Swagger UI displays endpoints, parameters, and request/response formats.
2. **Interactive Testing**: Try out API calls directly in the browser to validate behavior.
3. **Consistency and Compliance**: Helps ensure APIs follow a standard structure, improving developer usability.
4. **Code Generation**: Simplifies creating client and server stubs from the OpenAPI specification.

## Generating Swagger in a Spring Project

%%
To set up Swagger in a Spring application:
%%

---

1. **Add Swagger Dependencies**
   - In your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`, add the following dependency for Swagger:

```gradle
implementation 'org.springdoc:springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui:2.6.0'
```

---

2. **Enable Swagger Configuration**
   - Set up Swagger by configuring it to scan your API controllers:

```yml
springdoc:
  api-docs:
    path: /api-docs
  swagger-ui:
    path: /swagger-ui.html
```

---

3. **Access Swagger UI**
   - Start your Spring application, then access the Swagger UI interface at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html (default path).
