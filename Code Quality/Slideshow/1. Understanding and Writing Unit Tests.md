## Introduction to Unit Testing

%%
A **unit test** is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the functionality of a specific section of code, typically a single function or method. The primary goal is to ensure that each unit performs as expected, independently of other parts of the program.

### Characteristics of Unit Tests

- **Isolation**
- **Automation**
- **Speed**

%%
- **Isolation**: Tests are designed to assess a single piece of code without dependencies on external systems (like databases or APIs).
- **Automation**: Unit tests are typically automated and can be run frequently to catch regressions.
- **Speed**: They execute quickly, providing immediate feedback to developers.

## How to Write a Unit Test

---
### Steps to Write a Unit Test

1. Choose a Testing Framework
2. Create a Test Class
3. Write Test Methods

%% 
1. **Choose a Testing Framework**: Select a framework appropriate for your programming language.
2. **Create a Test Class**: This class will contain your test methods.
3. **Write Test Methods**: Develop methods to verify specific functionalities.
 %%

#### Code to Test:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

#### Unit Test:

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {
    
    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
        assertEquals(0, calc.add(-1, 1));
        assertEquals(0, calc.add(0, 0));
        assertEquals(3000, calc.add(1000, 2000));
    }
}
```

### Example of a Unit Test Scenario

%%
Consider a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. A unit test for this function would check various input scenarios, such as positive lengths, zero, and negative values.
%%

```java
public class Rectangle {
	public double calculateArea(double length, double width) {
		if (length < 0 || width < 0) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Length and width must be non-negative");
		}
		return length * width;
	}
}
```

---
#### JUnit Test Class for Rectangle

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import com.example.app.Rectangle;

public class RectangleTest {

    // Test for calculating area with positive lengths
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAreaWithPositiveValues() {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
        assertEquals(20.0, rect.calculateArea(4.0, 5.0), 0.001);
        assertEquals(50.0, rect.calculateArea(10.0, 5.0), 0.001);
    }

    // Test for calculating area with zero length
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAreaWithZeroLength() {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
        assertEquals(0.0, rect.calculateArea(0.0, 5.0), 0.001);
        assertEquals(0.0, rect.calculateArea(0.0, 0.0), 0.001);
    }

    // Test for calculating area with zero width
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAreaWithZeroWidth() {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
        assertEquals(0.0, rect.calculateArea(5.0, 0.0), 0.001);
    }

    // Test for calculating area with negative length
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAreaWithNegativeLength() {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
        Exception exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            rect.calculateArea(-1.0, 5.0);
        });
        assertEquals("Length and width must be non-negative", exception.getMessage());
    }

    // Test for calculating area with negative width
    @Test
    public void testCalculateAreaWithNegativeWidth() {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
        Exception exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
            rect.calculateArea(5.0, -1.0);
        });
        assertEquals("Length and width must be non-negative", exception.getMessage());
    }
}
```

##### The Test Methods

1. testCalculateAreaWithPositiveValues
2. testCalculateAreaWithZeroLength
3. testCalculateAreaWithZeroWidth
4. testCalculateAreaWithNegativeLength
5. testCalculateAreaWithNegativeWidth

%%
1. **testCalculateAreaWithPositiveValues**: This test verifies that the `calculateArea` method correctly computes the area for positive length and width values.
2. **testCalculateAreaWithZeroLength**: This test checks the output when the length is zero. The expected area is `0.0`.
3. **testCalculateAreaWithZeroWidth**: This test ensures that the area is also `0.0` when the width is zero.
4. **testCalculateAreaWithNegativeLength**: This test asserts that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the length is negative. It checks that the exception message matches the expected error message.
5. **testCalculateAreaWithNegativeWidth**: Similarly, this test verifies that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown for a negative width.

## Why Unit Tests Matter

1. **Early Bug Detection**
2. **Facilitating Changes**
3. **Living Documentation**
4. **Cost Reduction**
5. **Increased Confidence**

%%
Unit tests are crucial in the software development lifecycle for several reasons:

1. **Early Bug Detection**: They help identify errors early, reducing the cost of fixing bugs later in the development process.

2. **Facilitating Changes**: A comprehensive suite of tests allows developers to make changes or refactor code confidently, knowing that existing functionality is protected.

3. **Living Documentation**: Unit tests serve as up-to-date documentation for expected behavior, making it easier for new developers to understand the codebase.

4. **Cost Reduction**: Fixing bugs during development is significantly cheaper than addressing them after deployment.

5. **Increased Confidence**: Good test coverage increases developer confidence in the stability and reliability of the software.

**Real-World Impact**
In organizations that emphasize unit testing, the quality of the code improves significantly, leading to fewer bugs in production and reduced maintenance costs.

## Best Practices for Unit Testing

- **Descriptive Naming**
- **Single Assertion Per Test**
- **Independent Tests**
- **Keep Tests Simple**
- **Run Tests Frequently**

%%
To maximize the effectiveness of your unit tests, adhere to the following best practices:

- **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your test methods that explain what is being tested. For example, `test_calculate_area_with_positive_values` is more informative than `test_case_1`.
  
- **Single Assertion Per Test**: Each test should ideally contain only one assertion. This practice simplifies debugging because when a test fails, you know exactly which behavior was not met.

- **Independent Tests**: Ensure that each test can run independently. Avoid sharing state between tests to prevent side effects that might affect test results.

- **Keep Tests Simple**: Avoid complex logic in your tests. Each test should focus on a single behavior of the unit being tested.

- **Run Tests Frequently**: Integrate the execution of tests into your development workflow, such as during continuous integration, to ensure that new code does not introduce regressions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Testing Implementation Instead of Behavior**
- **Ignoring Edge Cases**
- **Overly Complex Tests**
- **Not Updating Tests with Code Changes**
- **Neglecting Test Execution**

%%
When writing unit tests, be mindful of the following common pitfalls:

- **Testing Implementation Instead of Behavior**: Avoid tests that check how a function works internally rather than what it outputs. Focus on the expected outcomes.
  
- **Ignoring Edge Cases**: Ensure to test boundary conditions and edge cases, such as empty inputs or maximum values, to verify robustness.

- **Overly Complex Tests**: Keep tests straightforward. If a test is complex, consider breaking it down into simpler tests.

- **Not Updating Tests with Code Changes**: Whenever you change functionality, remember to update the corresponding tests to reflect the new behavior.

- **Neglecting Test Execution**: Always run your tests after making changes to ensure no regressions are introduced.
