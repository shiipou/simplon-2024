## Introduction to TDD

%%
**Test Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. The main goal is to ensure that the code meets the requirements from the outset.

### Key Principles of TDD

- **Write Tests First**
- **Incremental Development**
- **Refactoring**

%%
- **Write Tests First**: Developers start by writing a failing test case that defines a desired improvement or new function.
- **Incremental Development**: Code is developed in small increments, allowing for frequent feedback and adjustments. Which will help to do unitary commits.
- **Refactoring**: After passing the test, code can be refactored for optimization, maintaining the same functionality.

## The TDD Cycle

1. **Write a Test**
2. **Write the Code**
3. **Run the Test**
4. **Fix the Code**
5. **Run Tests Again**
6. **Refactor Code**

%%
The TDD cycle is a continuous loop of writing tests, running them, writing the corresponding code, and refining the code to improve quality. 

1. **Write a Test**: Start with a test for a new function or behavior.
2. **Write the Code**: Implement the minimum code necessary to pass the test.
3. **Run the Test**: Verify that the test fails, confirming it’s correctly detecting the absence of functionality.
4. **Fix the code**: Fix the error in your algorithm highlighted by your tests.
5. **Run Tests Again**: Ensure that all tests, including the new one, pass.
6. **Refactor Code**: Clean up the code, ensuring it remains functional while improving structure and readability.

### Step 1: Write a Test

```java
@Test
public void testIsPrime() {
	// Succeed value
    assertTrue(isPrime(5));
    // Fail value
    assertFalse(isPrime(4));
    // Fail as specific case value
    assertTrue(isPrime(1));
}
```

---
### #### Step 2: Write the Code

```java
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    if (number < 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

---
#### Step 3: Run Tests

❌

The test fails because `number` must be `less or equals` than `1`.

---
#### Step 4: Fix the Code

```java
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    if (number <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

---
#### Step 5: Run Tests Again

✅

Now the test passes!

---
#### Step 6: Refactor

```java
public boolean isPrime(int number) {
    if (number <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= number; i++) { // Optimize loop condition
        if (number % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## Benefits of TDD

1. **Improved Code Quality**
2. **Clearer Requirements** 
3. **Faster Debugging**
4. **Documentation through Tests**
5. **Increased Confidence**

%%
TDD offers several advantages:

1. **Improved Code Quality**: Regular testing ensures that bugs are caught early and that the code meets specifications.
2. **Clearer Requirements**: Writing tests first clarifies what the code is supposed to accomplish.
3. **Faster Debugging**: Identifying and fixing issues becomes easier with a suite of automated tests.
4. **Documentation through Tests**: Tests serve as living documentation that reflects the current code behavior.
5. **Increased Confidence**: Developers can confidently make changes, knowing that existing functionality is tested.

## Best Practices for TDD

- **Write Clear and Descriptive Tests**
- **Keep Tests Isolated**
- **Test One Thing at a Time**
- **Use Mocks and Stubs Wisely**
- **Embrace Refactoring**

%%
To maximize the effectiveness of TDD, follow these best practices:

- **Write Clear and Descriptive Tests**: Use meaningful names that describe the expected behavior.
- **Keep Tests Isolated**: Ensure that tests don’t depend on each other to avoid cascading failures.
- **Test One Thing at a Time**: Each test should verify a single behavior or outcome.
- **Use Mocks and Stubs Wisely**: Utilize mocks and stubs for external dependencies to isolate tests.
- **Embrace Refactoring**: Regularly refactor code to improve clarity and maintainability without changing functionality.

## Common Challenges with TDD

- **Time Constraints**
- **Overemphasis on Testing**
- **Resistance to Change**
- **Inadequate Test Coverage**
- **Complexity in Tests**

%%
Be aware of these challenges when implementing TDD:

- **Time Constraints**: Initial test writing can seem time-consuming, but it pays off in the long run.
- **Overemphasis on Testing**: Focus on writing meaningful tests rather than achieving 100 percent coverage.
- **Resistance to Change**: Teams may resist adopting TDD; fostering a culture of testing is essential.
- **Inadequate Test Coverage**: Ensure tests cover edge cases and critical paths in the code.
- **Complexity in Tests**: Keep tests simple and understandable to avoid maintenance headaches.
